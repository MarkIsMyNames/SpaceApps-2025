# Optimized Tile-Based Image Viewer - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented an optimized tile-based image viewer with dynamic loading that only fetches the necessary tiles based on the user's current viewport position during panning. The system intelligently loads high-resolution tiles for the visible area and low-resolution preview tiles for surrounding context.

## Backend Changes (backend/app.py)

### 1. Preview Directory Constant and File Naming
- Added `PREVIEW_DIR = 'image_previews'` constant to manage preview tile directory
- High-res tiles follow the naming pattern: `r###_c###.{ext}` (e.g., `r000_c063.jpg`)
- Preview tiles follow the naming pattern: `r###_c###_preview.{ext}` (e.g., `r000_c063_preview.png`)
- Backend regex patterns updated to match actual file names (removed incorrect `tile_` prefix assumption)

### 2. Enhanced `/api/tiles/meta` Endpoint
The metadata endpoint now returns additional preview information:
```json
{
  "minRow": 0,
  "maxRow": 63,
  "minCol": 0,
  "maxCol": 126,
  "tileWidth": 128,
  "tileHeight": 128,
  "extensions": ["png"],
  "centerRow": 31,
  "centerCol": 63,
  "hasPreview": true,
  "previewWidth": 64,
  "previewHeight": 64,
  "previewExtensions": ["png"]
}
```

### 3. Preview Tile Serving Route
- New endpoint: `/api/tiles/preview/<int:r>/<int:c>`
- Serves low-resolution preview tiles from the `image_previews` directory
- Supports multiple formats (png, jpg, jpeg, webp)
- Returns 404 if preview not found

## Frontend Changes (frontend/src/components/TileViewer.tsx)

### 1. Enhanced Type Definitions
```typescript
interface TileMeta {
  // ... existing fields ...
  hasPreview: boolean;
  previewWidth: number;
  previewHeight: number;
  previewExtensions: string[];
}

interface Tile {
  row: number;
  col: number;
  url: string;
  type: 'high' | 'low';
  distance: number;
}
```

### 2. Zone-Based Loading System
Three concentric zones control tile loading:
- **HIGHRES_RADIUS (512px)**: High-resolution tiles for the visible 1024x1024 viewport
- **LOWRES_RADIUS (1024px)**: Low-resolution preview tiles for surrounding context
- **CLEANUP_RADIUS (1536px)**: Beyond this distance, tiles are unloaded to free memory

### 3. Dynamic Tile Management
- Replaced static tile array with dynamic `Map<string, Tile>`
- Tiles are keyed by `"row_col"` format
- Automatic memory management with blob URL cleanup

### 4. Core Functions

#### `calculateTileDistance()`
Calculates the distance from a tile's center to the viewport center in world coordinates.

#### `loadTile()`
Asynchronously loads either high-res or low-res tiles based on type parameter.

#### `updateTiles()`
The core optimization function that:
1. Calculates world center of viewport
2. Scans tiles in scan radius
3. Categorizes tiles by zone (high-res, low-res, or cleanup)
4. Sorts by distance for prioritized loading
5. Loads high-res tiles immediately (batch)
6. Loads low-res tiles in background
7. Replaces low-res with high-res when available
8. Unloads distant tiles and revokes blob URLs

### 5. Pan-Based Updates
- Pan state changes trigger tile updates with 150ms debouncing
- Prevents excessive loading during fast panning
- Smooth, responsive experience

### 6. Two-Pass Rendering
Rendering happens in two passes for seamless overlay:

**First Pass (Low-Res):**
- Renders preview tiles with 2px blur filter
- 90% opacity for blurred context
- z-index: 1

**Second Pass (High-Res):**
- Renders full-resolution tiles on top
- Sharp, crisp detail
- z-index: 2
- Automatically overlays and replaces low-res tiles

## Key Features

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading**: Only loads tiles visible or near the viewport
2. **Progressive Loading**: Low-res previews load first for immediate context
3. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of distant tiles
4. **Batch Loading**: High-res tiles load in parallel batches
5. **Debouncing**: Prevents excessive loads during panning
6. **Blob URLs**: Efficient binary data handling

### User Experience
1. **Instant Feedback**: Low-res previews appear immediately
2. **Seamless Transitions**: High-res overlays appear smoothly over previews
3. **Smooth Panning**: requestAnimationFrame for 60fps panning
4. **Visual Feedback**: Status bar shows tile counts and pan position
5. **No Loading Screens**: Continuous interaction while loading

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Center (512px radius)**: Crisp high-resolution detail
- **Border (512-1024px)**: Blurred preview context
- **Beyond (1024px+)**: Empty space (tiles unloaded)

## How It Works

### Initial Load
1. Fetch tile metadata including preview information
2. Calculate initial pan to center on `centerRow`/`centerCol`
3. Load initial high-res and low-res tiles based on zones
4. Render immediately when first tiles arrive

### During Panning
1. User drags to pan the viewport
2. Pan state updates trigger `updateTiles()` after 150ms debounce
3. System calculates new world center
4. Identifies needed tiles in each zone
5. Loads missing high-res tiles (priority)
6. Loads missing low-res tiles (background)
7. Replaces low-res with high-res when entering center zone
8. Unloads tiles beyond cleanup radius
9. Re-renders with updated tile map

### Memory Management
- Old blob URLs are revoked when tiles are replaced or removed
- Tiles beyond cleanup radius are automatically removed
- Map size grows/shrinks dynamically based on pan position
- No memory leaks from accumulated blob URLs

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Initial Load**: Verify center tiles load first
2. **Panning**: Smooth transitions between low-res and high-res
3. **Edge Cases**: Pan to image boundaries
4. **Performance**: Monitor memory usage during extended panning
5. **Network**: Test with slow connections (low-res should appear first)
6. **Cleanup**: Verify tiles unload when panning away

## Configuration

Adjust these constants in `TileViewer.tsx` to tune behavior:
```typescript
const HIGHRES_RADIUS = 512;   // Visible area size
const LOWRES_RADIUS = 1024;   // Preview border size
const CLEANUP_RADIUS = 1536;  // Unload distance
```

Debounce timing (line 202):
```typescript
const debounceTimer = setTimeout(() => {
  updateTiles(tileMeta, panState.x, panState.y);
}, 150); // Adjust milliseconds as needed
```

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files
- `backend/app.py`: Added preview support and new endpoint
- `frontend/src/components/TileViewer.tsx`: Complete rewrite with dynamic loading

### No Changes Required
- Backend tile serving logic (existing endpoints work as-is)
- Tile generation scripts (preview tiles already created)
- CSS styling (TileViewer.css unchanged)

## Success Metrics

✅ High-res tiles load only for visible 1024x1024 area
